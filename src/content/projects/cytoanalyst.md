CytoAnalyst is a web application designed for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. 
It provides a user-friendly interface for researchers to perform various analyses on their scRNA-seq datasets, 
including quality control, normalization, integration, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression analysis.

The application is built using modern web technologies, including React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
To build the application,
I did a comprehensive literature review on scRNA-seq analysis methods and best practices and consulted with bioinformatics experts.

It is free to use here: [https://cytoanalyst.com](https://cytoanalyst.com).
